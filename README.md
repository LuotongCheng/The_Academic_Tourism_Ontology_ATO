# Academic Tourism Ontology (ATO)

The **Academic Tourism Ontology (ATO)** is a semantic framework designed to analyze and explore the key relationships among elements such as people, places, and events within historical travelogs. By aligning with **CIDOC CRM** and leveraging controlled vocabularies, ATO adheres to **Linked Open Data (LOD)** principles, enabling the integration of external contextual sources and enhancing data interoperability and reusability. This ontology supports cross-disciplinary research infrastructure, facilitating comparative and spatial analysis within cultural heritage and literary studies.

## Dataset

The original dataset includes three travel accounts documenting journeys through Germany by Groningen students in the nineteenth century, including a published work, *Brieven, geschreven op eene wandeling door een gedeelte van Duitschland en Holland* (1809-1810) by Barthold Henrik Lulofs, Theodorus van Swinderen, and Jan Jacob Modderman; a manuscript from 1816 by Reneke de Marees van Swinderen, housed in the Groninger Archieven; and a manuscript from 1819 by Ulrich Herman Wielinga Huber, preserved in Treseor, Leeuwarden. The texts have already been scanned and are available in digital format. Domain experts selected several representative letters that contain important elements and entities, such as places, people, objects, and events. Specifically, Brief IV from GÃ¶ttingen (July 9, 1816) and Brief V (July 12, 1816) serve as example letters for showcasing the ontology.
